# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Cleaning and analysing the data will be done using Pandas through Python in Jupyter Notebook. 

## Database Storage
Our database will be stored and managed in SQL using Postgres. 

## Machine Learning
Using the SciKitLearn Python library we will develop, test, and train our model. 

## Dashboard
We will use Flask to deploy our model through an interactive dashboard designed using Javascript D3 for a combination of HTML, Canvas, and SVG.
Heroku will be used for hosting.
